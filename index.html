            <p>Universal Basic Income (UBI) is a form of social security that guarantees a certain amount of money to an

                                                <p>In the wake of this advancement, it is becoming more clear there is
                                                    simply no need for everyone to work in order to survive. Humanity as

                                            society. And without work, not everyone is intrinsically motivated to engage
                                            in ways that society sees as valuable. Thus begs the question, why should a

                                                of unemployed American adults have been treated
                                                for depression</a> after being unemployed for 27 weeks or longer. It is
                                            perhaps because of this that <a

                                                survey participants</a> favor a national service program that would
                                            compensate humans to perform
                                            jobs even if machines could outperform them (58%), almost as equally as they
                                            favor having a guaranteed income (60%).</p>
                                        <p>Also important to note is that many experts predict that automated

                                            dangerous tasks. This in effect <em>raises</em> human labor capital, in that
                                            these workers can elevate to higher-level tasks such as leadership,

                                                <p>Just because someone receives UBI doesn’t mean that they are
                                                    disincentivized to work. UBI is given unconditionally at a fixed
                                                    amount, which means that people can bring in additional income
                                                    through jobs. And those UBI recipients that do have a job have more
                                                    power to negotiate salary, benefits, and work conditions that they
                                                    perhaps otherwise wouldn't, because they have the security of an
                                                    unconditional income if the employer refuses their requests.</p>
                                                <p>And even among those who don't have jobs, there is still
                                                    theoretically enough money provided to people by UBIs for them to
                                                    continue supporting the economy. Under normal circumstances,
                                                    economies suffer when there's a downturn, which results in employers
                                                    firing workers, who themselves then lose buying power, which in turn
                                                    reduces demand on products, in response to which businesses are
                                                    forced to lay off even more people, and so goes the vicious cycle. A
                                                    UBI underpins spending, so economies don’t flounder as badly in a
                                                    recession. </p>
                                                <p>In any case, there are plenty of people who are on welfare who cannot
                                                    work. And because such means-tested programs have a tendency to
                                                    overlook different demographics, there is an inflated amount of
                                                    welfare programs. Despite this saturation, vulnerable people still
                                                    go unsupported. A UBI would make it so that it is cheaper to
                                                    administer critical support than a welfare system, in that it simply
                                                    involves a uniform and regular deposit to every single person, which
                                                    would consequently significantly reduce overhead costs.</p>

                                        <p>It’s easy to take advantage of something that is free. Even if UBI amounts
                                            were fixed at a low rate, it may still be easier to live modestly than to
                                            hold down a job that may provide additional income, and doing so may slow
                                            consumerism and therefore the overall economy.</p>
                                        <p> Regardless of the fixed rate, UBI is just another name for a welfare state.
                                            Providing all citizens with a basic income would considerably increase the
                                            share of people receiving benefits and as a result inflict massive costs. <a
                                                href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/modeling-macroeconomic-effects-ubi/">Experts
                                                at the Roosevelt Institute</a> conclude that funding for the program is
                                            acheivable through increasing federal deficits - a counterintuitive measure,
                                            some would say, in which supporting the populous means plunging them further
                                            into debt.</p>
                                        <p>Moreover, there is no plan in place to transition people out of welfare
                                            systems and into UBIs. Many people have become reliant on welfare and see
                                            more money coming to them through those systems than would UBI alone.
                                            Targeted aid helps people with specific challenges in a way that UBI cannot.
                                            Furthermore, to suggest a UBI replacement for social security systems is
                                            political suicide, especially because older populations receiveing benefits
                                            are among the most mobilized constituents. It is likely that UBI will be
                                            implemented <em>in addition</em> to welfare programs, and that this in turn
                                            empowers the state to have more control of citizen welfare, and not the
                                            citizens themselves.
